# Let there be light

I was really mad at some other apps on Play store that were supposed to turn on the camera flash light but did a really poor job at that.

So here it is a pretty simple app that you can use to do that. There is still no layout and all but it works (as tested on a Razr I).

You can even press the power button, so that the phone sleep, after turning the flash on. This really helps on situations where we are holding the phone and don't want to press any buttons, etc.
